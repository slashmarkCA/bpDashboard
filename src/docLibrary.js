            <h3>What is this chart?</h3>
            <p>
                This is a bar chart called a "Histogram" that groups the Pulse Pressure measurement from individual readings into "density" buckets, categorizes them, and counts how many readings are in each bucket.
            </p>
            <h3>What is Pulse Pressure?</h3>
            <p>
                Pulse pressure is the difference between your systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings (Sys minus Dia). 
                It represents the force or pressure wave that the heart generates each time it beats and contracts, and are categorized as such:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><span style="color: var(--pp-narrow); font-size: 1.2em;">●</span> <u>Narrowed (Low): <40 mmHg</u><br>
                    <small>Sometimes defined as pressure that is less than 25% of the systolic pressure. Can be a sign of the heart not pumping enough blood.</small>
                </li>
                <li><span style="color: var(--pp-normal); font-size: 1.2em;">●</span> <u>Normal: 40-60 mmHg</u><br>
                    <small>This is often cited as the healthy range.</small>
                </li>
                <li><span style="color: var(--pp-widened); font-size: 1.2em;">●</span> <u>Widened (High): 61-100 mmHg</u><br>
                    <small>Often a sign of stiffer arteries (arteriosclerosis), which increases risk of heart attack and stroke.</small>
                </li>
                <li><span style="color: var(--pp-very-widened); font-size: 1.2em;">●</span> <u>Very Widened: >100 mmHg</u><br>
                    <small>Considered severe and may indicate significant cardiovascular issues.</small>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What does it tell me?</h3>
            <ul>It answers risk questions like:
                <li>How often was I in a 'Very Widened' state?</li>
                <li>How often was I in the bottom end of the 'Narrowed' category?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What to look for:</h3>  
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The "Peak":</strong> Which bucket has the highest bar? This represents your "dominant" state. Ideally, your highest bars should be in the 'Normal' green zone.</li>
                <li><strong>Spread (Standard Deviation):</strong> A "thin" histogram where all bars are close together shows stability. A "wide" histogram with bars scattered across many categories shows high variability in how your heart and arteries are responding to daily life.</li>
                <li><strong>Skew:</strong> Look for "trailing" bars. If you have a few bars in the 'Very Widened' category, even if most are 'Normal,' those outliers are important to discuss as they represent periods of high cardiovascular stress.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What does it tell me?</h3>
            <p>
                It allows you to see the direction of your pulse pressure readings (without gaps if you miss recording a day or a few).
                <ul>
                    <li>Filtering: By zooming into 7, 14, or 30 days, you can see if your pulse pressure is consistently widening or narrowing over time, which can reflect changes in arterial health or heart efficiency.</li>
                    <li>Trend Direction: The slope of the dashed lines indicates whether your average pulse pressure is trending upward, downward, or remaining stable across the entries shown.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>What to look for:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The Trendline: This helps your doctor see the general trajectory of your pulse pressure, even if individual readings vary significantly (e.g. taking a reading just after you finished excercising).</li>
                <li>Consistency: Look at how closely your points hug the trendline. Wildly bouncing spikes is a valuable point to discuss with your healthcare provider.</li>
                <li>Consistent Widening: If your trendline is sloping upward (getting wider), it may be a valuable data point for your doctor to investigate cardiovascular stiffness, regardless of your systolic/diastolic averages.</li>

        <h3>What is this chart?</h3>
        <p>While your line chart shows the sequence of readings, this chart shows the spread within each week. It uses "Box &amp; Whisker" plots to group your data into weekly snapshots:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The Box (The "Meat"): Represents where the middle 50% of your readings "live."</li>
        <li>The Whiskers: These extend to your absolute highest and lowest readings for that week.</li>
        <li>The Center Line: Represents your <u>Median</u> (middle) reading.</li>
        <li>The Big Dot: Represents your mathematical Average (<u>Mean</u>).</li>
        <li>Circles (Outliers): Represent "unusual" readings&mdash;spikes or dips that are statistically far away from your typical cluster.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What does it tell me?</h3>
        <p>This chart measures Stability. High blood pressure is a concern, but highly variable blood pressure (wide swings) is a specific clinical marker that doctors often look for.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Tall Boxes/Long Whiskers: Indicate high volatility&mdash;meaning your pressure is swinging widely between highs and lows.</li>
        <li>Short Boxes/Short Whiskers: Indicate stability&mdash;meaning your pressure is staying within a consistent, predictable range.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What to look for:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>The "Spike" Factor: Watch the top whiskers. Even if your average is fine, growing whiskers may indicate that your "spikes" are getting wider or more frequent.</li>
        <li>Weekly Comparison: Compare the boxes week-over-week. Are they getting shorter? That&rsquo;s a sign that your blood pressure is becoming more stable, which is often a primary goal of a management plan.</li>
        <li>Outliers: Occasional circles at the very top or bottom can help you identify one-off events (like a high-stress day or a skipped medication) versus a systemic change in your health.</li>

        content: `
            <h3>What is MAP?</h3>
            <p>Mean Arterial Pressure represents the average pressure in your arteries during one full cardiac cycle. It is often a more reliable indicator of organ perfusion (blood flow) than Systolic pressure alone.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Normal Range:</strong> 70 – 100 mmHg.</p>

            <h3>How to Read This Chart</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Daily MAP (Blue):</strong> The average of all readings taken on a single day.</li>
                <li><strong>7-Day Rolling MAP (Orange):</strong> A rolling average that includes the current day and the 6 most recent days of activity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What to Look For</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Gap:</strong> If the Orange line is significantly smoother than the Blue points, your 7-day average is successfully filtering out daily "spikes" to show your true baseline.</li>
                <li><strong>The 70 mmHg Floor:</strong> Clinical guidelines suggest a MAP of at least 60–70 mmHg is necessary to ensure organs receive enough oxygenated blood.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp</p>
            <p>* A little note: MAP is not a simple average of Systolic and Diastolic. Because the heart spends twice as much time in Diastole (resting/filling) as it does in Systole (contracting), the Diastolic number is weighted more heavily in the calculation.</p>
